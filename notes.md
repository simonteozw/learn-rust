- let variables by default can only be assigned a value when declared
- ! means calling a rust macro
- a reference is created by & and dereferenced by *
- & in rust is read as borrow
- strings in rust can be of 2 types, slice string or allocated string
- slice string = &str (eg. s = "hello")
- allocated string = String (eg. t = s.to_string())
- relationship between slice and allocated string is similat to relationship between array and vector
- borrow operator can coerce String into &str
